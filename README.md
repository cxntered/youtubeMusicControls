# `YouTubeMusicControls`

A [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) plugin that adds a [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) player above the account panel in Discord.

Based on the [SpotifyControls](https://vencord.dev/plugins/SpotifyControls) plugin built into Vencord. **Requires** the [YouTube Music Desktop App](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music) to be running.

## Usage

Firstly, make sure you are using the [YouTube Music Desktop App](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music). Enable the `API Server [Beta]` plugin, set the "Authorization strategy" to either "No authorization" (recommended) or "Authorize at first request" and keep all other settings as default.

Then, following [this guide](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins) to setup Vencord for custom plugins, `git clone` this repository into the `src/userplugins` directory of your Vencord installation, run `pnpm build` to build Vencord, inject with `pnpm inject`, and restart Discord.

After that, you can enable the plugin in the Vencord settings under "Plugins" and it should start working, as long as you have the YouTube Music Desktop App running.

## Questions and Answers

### Why does the player not show up?

Make sure the `API Server [Beta]` plugin is enabled, and that its using the following settings:

- **Hostname:** `0.0.0.0`
- **Port:** `26538`

If you have the authorization strategy set to "Authorize at first request", make sure to accept the authorization request in the YouTube Music Desktop App pop-up when prompted, and if you are using a different port, you can change it in the plugin settings. If it still doesn't work, [make an issue](https://github.com/cxntered/youtubeMusicControls/issues).

### How do I style the player?

The player uses the exact same styles as the `SpotifyControls` plugin, except every instance of `spotify` is renamed to `ytmusic`.

### Why does it make requests so frequently?

...yeah ðŸ˜­

Since the YouTube Music Desktop App does not provide a websocket API, the plugin has to poll the API periodically to get the current song and player state. This is ~~probably~~ definitely not ideal whatsoever, but unless I'm stupid, it is the only way to reliably get the current state of the player as it could become desynced if the user changes anything in the YouTube Music Desktop App.

If you don't really care about the player state being 100% accurate, you can change the polling interval in the plugin settings (by default its 5000ms).

## Disclaimer

This is my first Vencord plugin, so it is probably (definitely) not the best code ever. If you have any issues, suggestions or improvements, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/cxntered/youtubeMusicControls/issues) or [make a pull request](https://github.com/cxntered/youtubeMusicControls/pulls).

## To Do

- [ ] PR a websocket API to YTMDA and use that instead of polling
- [x] Allow using "Authorize at first request" as an authorization strategy
- [x] Merge pre- and post-visual refresh styles
- [x] Poll less frequently if API server isn't running
- [x] Add compatibility with `SpotifyControls`
- [x] Clean up code
- [x] Add a setting to change the polling interval
